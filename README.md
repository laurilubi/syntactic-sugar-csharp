# Syntactic sugar for C#
To simplify coding and making code more readable by showing the intention. One step from `what` closer to `why`. The library is designed to make the call-site side simpler.

# Assert
`AssertTools` are there to show the intent when guarding eg input parameters or values from the database. The execution will not continue unless the assertion is true.

# Parsing simple value types
`IntTools`, `TimeSpanTools` and etc are useful when getting values from something external as they handle string format and nulls in a simple way (for call-site).
